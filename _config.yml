 bio: "I am an amateur/hobby photographer from Copenhagen. When I'm not working as a civil engineer I like to take pictures of everything from landscapes, urban/street, to portrait and travel photography. If you need your picture taken or of something else, contact me on IG, FB or kim@bastian.biz and lets have a talk."
